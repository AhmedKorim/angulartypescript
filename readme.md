This folder contains code samples from the book "Angular Development with TypeScript", Second Edition (see https://www.manning.com/books/angular-development-with-typescript-second-edition). It's work in progress. Currently only some code samples migrated to Angular 5.

We used Angular CLI 1.5.0 for projects generation. You may need to install it globally to run these samples.
